# VoiceOver for World of Warcraft [esES]

This repository has been created to support the spanish (es-ES) voices generation for [WoW VoiceOver Addon](https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover)

You can find Spanish generation examples on the [repository webpage](https://latra.github.io/wow-webvoices-esES) and provide some feedback about the quality.

The Voice Clonning Dataset used is based on World of Warcraft NPC voices, availables on [WoWHead](https://www.wowhead.com/classic/es/sounds), and some additions from Warcraft 3. 

### You can download the Voices dataset that I'm using [HERE]()



## Voice Generation
The english version provided by [mrthinger](https://github.com/mrthinger) and the team that's behind the addon was created by using [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/). 

In this spanish version, since I'm doing it to test other projects that I was working on and testing some open source AI models, the TTS and VoiceClonning is based on open source models and technologies, like:

- [xTTS v2](https://coqui.ai/blog/tts/open_xtts) from [Coqui](https://github.com/coqui-ai)
- [VITS](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits/) from [Jaehyeon Kim](https://github.com/jaywalnut310), [Jungil Kong](https://github.com/jik876), and [Juhee Son](https://github.com/juheeuu)
- [FreeVC](https://github.com/OlaWod/FreeVC) from [Jing-Yi Li](https://github.com/OlaWod)
